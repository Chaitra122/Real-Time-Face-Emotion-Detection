# Real-Time-Face-Emotion-Detection
This project leverages OpenCV and deep learning to perform real-time emotion detection on faces from a webcam or video input. It identifies facial expressions and categorizes them into emotions such as happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, fear, and neutral. The system uses OpenCV for face detection and image processing, while a pre-trained deep learning model is used for emotion classification. The project is designed to run in real-time, with emotion labels displayed on detected faces as they appear in the video feed.

The setup requires Python 3.6+, along with several libraries like OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and imutils. These dependencies can be easily installed via pip. After cloning the repository and setting up the environment, users can run the emotion detection script, which will access the webcam and display emotion predictions for any faces detected in the video feed. The model used for emotion recognition is typically a convolutional neural network (CNN), trained on a dataset like FER-2013. The project also provides a pre-trained model file (e.g., emotion_model.h5) that should be placed in the project directory to be used by the script for classification.

The face detection process uses OpenCVâ€™s Haar Cascade or DNN-based face detection methods to identify faces in each frame of the video. Once detected, the facial features are passed through the emotion recognition model, which outputs the emotion label in real-time. This project is ideal for applications where you want to analyze emotional expressions, such as for human-computer interaction, video conferencing, or emotion-based research.
